Movie Review Checker: Project Description
## Description
The Movie Review Checker is an advanced text classification project designed to analyze and determine the sentiment of movie reviews. This project leverages various text preprocessing techniques to prepare raw review data for accurate sentiment analysis.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection: Raw movie review data is collected from diverse sources, including websites and review platforms.

Preprocessing:

HTML Removal: The raw text is cleaned by removing any HTML tags to ensure that the text is in a readable format.
Lowercasing: All text is converted to lowercase to maintain uniformity and avoid case-sensitive discrepancies.
Punctuation Removal: Punctuation marks are removed as they do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
Stop Words Removal: Common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "and," "the") are removed to focus on important terms.
Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run") to standardize the text for analysis.
Feature Extraction: After preprocessing, features are extracted using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. This helps in converting text data into numerical vectors that can be used by machine learning models.

Model Training: A classification model, such as Logistic Regression, is trained on the processed data. The model learns to classify reviews into categories such as positive or negative based on the features extracted.

Evaluation: The model is tested and evaluated on a separate dataset to measure its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting sentiment.

Deployment: The trained model and preprocessing pipeline are saved and deployed for real-time review sentiment analysis. Users can input movie reviews, and the system will provide a sentiment score and classification.
